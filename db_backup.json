Starting out as a mechanical engineer, I took a leap of faith that led me to the world of full-stack development. I embraced the challenges of transitioning to software engineering, diving deep into Django, and cultivating a new set of skills that would redefine my career trajectory. This shift wasn't simply a change in job titles; it was a testament to my curiosity and drive to create something meaningful.</p>\r\n<p>My work in mechanical engineering, and later electro-mechanical engineering, provided me with a strong foundation in problem-solving and technical precision. But I was also seeking an outlet for my creativity, a space where technology, innovation, and imagination could coexist. I found that spark in programming and artificial intelligence. The decision to become a full-time developer for an AI-driven knowledge portal was transformative, not just for my career, but for the way I approach challenges and solutions.</p>\r\n<p>One of my most enjoyable pastimes involves working on 3D printers&mdash;designing, building, upgrading, and maintaining them. These hobbies allow me to express my creative side and keep learning hands-on technical skills, even as I pivot towards the digital landscape. There's something about creating something tangible out of a digital blueprint that speaks to both the engineer and the artist within me. It's a balance that I bring into my professional life, where I aim to merge the structural discipline of engineering with the creativity of development.</p>\r\n<p>Navigating the transition from engineering to software development required humility, a willingness to learn, and the courage to face the unknown. It has been a challenging but deeply rewarding process, reinvigorating my sense of creativity and reigniting my love for problem-solving. The experience has shown me the value of embracing change and pursuing my passions, even when it means stepping into uncharted territory. It has made me more adaptable and open to opportunities where I can integrate my diverse skills.</p>\r\n<p>I am always interested in connecting with others who share a passion for engineering, programming, or creative innovation. I believe in the power of collaboration and in exploring how diverse disciplines can converge to create something remarkable. If my journey resonates with you, or if you'd like to explore opportunities to work together, feel free to send me a message. Let's connect and continue to push the boundaries of what technology can do.</p>", "profilepicture": "profilepictures/profilepicture.jpg"}}][{"model": "portfolio.project", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "TFD-Bot", "created_at": "2024-11-03T18:54:26.541Z", "description": "<p>A Discord bot designed for games and quotes management, offering seamless community engagement.</p>", "projectpicture": "projectpictures/tfd-bot.png"}}, {"model": "portfolio.project", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "Harmonic Creator", "created_at": "2024-11-03T18:55:04.369Z", "description": "<p>HarmonicCreator allows users to make various calculations based on input from different models of slats for a pool cover.</p>\r\n<p>By leveraging advanced algorithms and user-friendly interfaces, HarmonicCreator simplifies the process of designing and evaluating pool covers, making it an essential tool for professionals in the industry.</p>", "projectpicture": "projectpictures/harmonic-creator.png"}}, {"model": "portfolio.project", "pk": 4, "fields": {"name": "BLT-MusicBot", "created_at": "2024-11-03T18:55:32.690Z", "description": "<p>A Discord bot that plays radio streams, bringing music and entertainment to your server.</p>\r\n<div><a href=\"https://github.com/Cyclosaryn/BLT-MusicBot\"><img src=\"https://assets.stickpng.com/images/5847f98fcef1014c0b5e48c0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"27\" height=\"26\"> BLT-MusicBot&nbsp;</a></div>", "projectpicture": "projectpictures/blt-musicbot.png"}}, {"model": "portfolio.project", "pk": 5, "fields": {"name": "Project Hermes", "created_at": "2024-11-03T18:56:11.619Z", "description": "<p>Hermes is a project in development designed to facilitate real-time collaboration on markdown files.&nbsp;It enables users within an organization to work together seamlessly, ensuring that everyone is on the same page.</p>\r\n<p>With Hermes, team members can edit, comment, and sync their changes instantly, making it easier to manage and share information efficiently.
